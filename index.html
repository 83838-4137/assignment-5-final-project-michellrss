        Santiago Reyes is a remarkable individual who embodies the American dream. Born in 1975 in the town of Guanajuato, Mexico, he immigrated to the United States at the age of 10, eventually making Houston, Texas, his hometown. A proud alumnus of the University of Texas, where he majored in business management, Santiago's entrepreneurial spirit and vision were truly ignited after a life-altering diagnosis of stage 3 lung cancer at the age of 38. During a two-year journey of recovery, Santiago found the inspiration to start his luxury watch company, Insight, which has since become a symbol of his tenacity and creativity.
